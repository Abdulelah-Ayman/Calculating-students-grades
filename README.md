## 🧠 Program Overview
1. The program asks the user to enter their mark.  
2. It reads the input using a `Scanner`.  
3. Based on the mark, it prints the corresponding grade:
   - `90–100` → **A**  
   - `80–89` → **B**  
   - `70–79` → **C**  
   - `60–69` → **D**  
   - Any other value → **"please enter a valid mark"**

The program assumes the mark is between 0 and 100.

You can easily extend the code to include more grade levels (e.g., F for failing marks).

The grade C is printed in lowercase; you may change it to uppercase for consistency.
